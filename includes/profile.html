			<h1>Profile</h1>
			<p>Bockman Forbes + Glasgow provides exciting, expressive, and high quality residential, commercial, and hospitality interior and architectural designs.</p>
			
			<p>The Studio's design philosophy adheres to modern spatial relationships, a graphic silhouette, a refined use of materials and a strong, sophisticated color palette. Whether combining a cherry-red Regency chandelier with a Saarinen lounge chair or refinishing a classical column in white lacquer, it's the Studio's unique ability to reinterpret the classics that give all their projects that "wow" factor.</p>
			
			<p>You might say we are the antithesis of 'Elegant Decay.'  While we deeply respect the historical nature of New Orleans, a little sprucing up doesn't sacrifice the integrity of our great architecture.  After all, people lived in these homes and buildings, but standards don't remain stuck in the 19th century. The magic happens when you mix-it-up no matter where the project is located.</p>
			
			<p>At our full-service studio, we approach each project with a fresh eye to envision narrative concepts appropriate for today's lifestyle which  express the studio's uncommon vision.  Architecturally, from Hong Kong to Philadelphia, we design project programs with boldness and clarity.</p>
