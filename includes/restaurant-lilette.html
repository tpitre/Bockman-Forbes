    	<div class="work-content">
	    	<p>"Lilette has an excellent, fresh French inspired menu and a great wine list. The service is expert and thoughtful. They have great salads and fresh vegetable items, and they are very accommodating. It's away from the French Quarter and the tourists on Magazine Street. There is the most beautiful and weird bathroom I saw in New Orleans... they have my favorite weird wallpaper there"</p>
